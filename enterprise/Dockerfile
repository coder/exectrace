# This is a multi-arch Dockerfile, so it cannot have ANY "RUN" commands as it's
# cross-compiled. All binaries are cross-compiled using the host's Go toolchain
# and then copied into the build context.
#
# This uses Ubuntu instead of Alpine Linux because the binaries are compiled
# with cgo due to dependencies requiring cgo.

# LABEL doesn't add any real layers so it's fine (and easier) to do it here than
